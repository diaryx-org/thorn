# First-time setup for the cross-platform drawing app (and whenever the Rust
# *API* changes):
#   1. regenerate the committed UniFFI binding under
#      packages/thorn-swift/uniffi-generated/ (scripts/gen-bindings.sh — after
#      an API change, `git diff` shows the binding move and the change is
#      committed with it; CI diffs the two, so a stale binding cannot merge)
#   2. run `xcodegen generate` to (re)create Thorn.xcodeproj
#
# The Rust *staticlib* for mac/simulator/device is NOT built here — the Xcode
# project's pre-build script (see project.yml) does that on every build, so
# ordinary Rust edits need only ⌘R in Xcode (or `cargo xtask swift`). Re-run
# this script only after changing the Rust API surface (new/renamed FFI
# methods), which requires regenerating the binding.

//! `cargo xtask swift` — build and launch Thorn, the AppKit/UIKit drawing app
//! in `apps/thorn-editor`, the host for the `packages/thorn-swift` editor.
//!
//! The chain behind that one word is four toolchains deep: cargo builds
//! `crates/thorn-svg-ffi`, uniffi-bindgen turns it into Swift, xcodegen turns
//! `project.yml` into an Xcode project, and xcodebuild builds the app (its own
//! pre-build script rebuilding the Rust staticlib for whichever destination is
//! selected). The first two and the third are `apps/thorn-editor/bootstrap.sh`'s
//! job and stay there — this task decides *when* they need to run, then builds
//! and launches.

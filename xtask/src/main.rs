//! The workspace's task runner — the [cargo-xtask] pattern: a plain Rust binary,
//! invoked as `cargo xtask <task>` through the alias in `.cargo/config.toml`, so
//! every developer already has the only toolchain it needs.
//!
//! Releasing is not here. It is `dx release`, from the org's devtools,
//! configured by `.config/release.toml`.

# UniFFI 0.32 needs a resvg-swift release

**What.** `thorn-svg-ffi` is on UniFFI 0.32, and `resvg-uniffi`, whose
scaffolding rides in the same staticlib, is still on 0.28 in every published
version. A binary links one UniFFI runtime, and 0.31 changed method
checksums, so until the two agree the lock carries both runtimes and the
Swift tests die with a contract-version mismatch in `ResvgFFI`.
resvg-swift's `5bfcf75` (`build(deps)!: uniffi 0.32`) moves it; it is
committed in that checkout and not yet released.

Until it is, build against that checkout: `[patch.crates-io] resvg-uniffi`
pointed at `../resvg-swift/crates/resvg-uniffi`, and
`swift package edit resvg-swift --path ../resvg-swift` for the Swift tests,
with `swift package unedit resvg-swift` after.

**Done when** resvg-swift has released it, `resvg-uniffi` in
`crates/thorn-svg-ffi/Cargo.toml` and `resvg-swift` in `Package.swift` are
moved to that version, and `cargo xtask ci` and `scripts/test-swift.sh` pass
with no patch.

**Done** 2026-09-26: resvg-swift 0.1.4 is the release, and both pins name it.
